#### Notes


This repository contains some experiments on using the Two Stream radiative transfer model to invert land surface parameters. The experiments are written in Python (2.7), and use [IPython notebooks](https://ipython.org/), and  requires the installation of the `eoldas_ng` package, as well as the `gp_emulators` packages, as well as the standar Python scientific stack ([numpy](http://numpy.org), [scipy](http://scipy.org) and [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org)). You can probably install most of this using the [Anaconda Python Distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads).
